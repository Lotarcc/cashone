# Expense Tracker - Frontend Development Plan

**Technology Stack:** Vue.js 3 with TypeScript, Vuex for state management, Vue Router for navigation.

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and responsive design.  Consider using a UI component library like Headless UI for more advanced components.

**UI Style:** Clean, minimalist design with a focus on usability and accessibility.  The color palette will be muted and calming, with clear visual hierarchy and intuitive navigation.  We will aim for a modern and professional look and feel.

**Phase 1: Project Setup (1 day)**

1.  **Create Vue.js project:** Use the Vue CLI to create a new project with TypeScript support: `vue create expense-tracker --typescript`.
2.  **Install necessary packages:** Install Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, Axios for API calls, and a charting library (e.g., Chart.js).
3.  **Configure API endpoints:** Define constants for the backend API endpoints (authentication, transactions, categories).

**Phase 2: Core Features (2 weeks)**

1.  **Authentication:** Implement user authentication using the backend API.  This will involve creating components for login and registration, handling token storage (localStorage or similar), and securing routes.  Error handling will be implemented using a centralized error handling mechanism.
2.  **Transaction Display:** Create a component to display transactions fetched from the backend API.  This should include features like pagination, sorting, filtering (by date, amount, category), and search.  The UI will use tables for clear data presentation.
3.  **Transaction Entry:** Develop forms for adding new transactions (expense, income, transfer).  These forms should validate user input and handle API calls to create new transactions.  Input validation will be performed both client-side and server-side.
4.  **Category Management:** Implement functionality to view, add, edit, and delete categories.  This could involve a dedicated component for managing categories.  The UI will use a modal for adding/editing categories.
5.  **Basic Charts:** Integrate Chart.js to display basic charts (bar chart for expenses by category, pie chart for expense distribution).  Charts will be responsive and interactive.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (1 week)**

1.  **Improved Charts:** Enhance the charts with interactive elements, better visualizations, and more advanced chart types as needed.  Consider adding drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.
2.  **Reporting:** Implement more advanced reporting features, such as generating reports for specific time periods or exporting data to CSV or PDF.  The reporting feature will allow users to download reports in various formats.
3.  **Data Visualization:** Explore more advanced data visualization techniques to provide users with better insights into their spending habits.  Consider using heatmaps or other visualizations to highlight spending patterns.
4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling throughout the application to provide informative messages to the user.  Error messages will be clear, concise, and helpful.

**Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (1 week)**
<UNNECESARY>
1.  **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for all components and functions using Jest and Vue Test Utils.
2.  **Integration Testing:** Test the integration between the frontend and backend using Cypress.
3.  **End-to-End Testing:** Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the entire application works as expected using Cypress.
4.  **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages).

**UI/UX Considerations:**

*   **User-friendly design:** Prioritize a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly design.
*   **Responsive design:** Ensure the application is responsive and works well on different devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).  Tailwind CSS will be instrumental in achieving this.
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to make the application usable for everyone.


**Technology Choices Rationale:**

*   **Vue.js:** A progressive JavaScript framework that is easy to learn and use.
*   **TypeScript:** Adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code maintainability and reducing errors.
*   **Vuex:**  Provides centralized state management for better data flow and maintainability.
*   **Vue Router:** Enables client-side routing for a seamless user experience.
*   **Tailwind CSS:**  A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
*   **Headless UI:** Provides accessible and customizable UI components.
*   **Axios:** A simple and widely used HTTP client for making API calls.
*   **Chart.js:** A popular charting library with a wide range of chart types.
*   **Jest & Vue Test Utils:**  For unit testing.
*   **Cypress:** For integration and end-to-end testing.
